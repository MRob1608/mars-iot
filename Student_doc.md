# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:

This project is a multi-container IoT monitoring and control system for a Mars habitat simulation. It ingests sensor and telemetry data from an external simulator (`mars-simulator`), routes data via RabbitMQ (`message-broker`), persists and applies automation rules using a PostgreSQL rules database (`rule-database`) and an automation engine (`automation-engine`), presents a real‑time dashboard and rule management UI via a Flask-based presentation service (`presentation-service`), maintains streaming state and forwards data to the frontend via a state service (`state`), and generates PDF reports for selected sensors via a report service (`report-service`).

# CONTAINERS:

## CONTAINER_NAME: mars-simulator

### DESCRIPTION:

External IoT simulator container providing sensor, telemetry, and actuator HTTP APIs, used as the data source and target for commands. Defined in `src/docker-compose.yml` as `mars-simulator` using image `mars-iot-simulator:multiarch_v1`.

### USER STORIES:

- Supports all user stories that depend on simulated sensors, telemetry, and actuators (monitoring, manual control, automation), by exposing:
  - Sensor endpoints such as `/api/sensors`, `/api/sensors/<sensor_id>` (referenced in ingestion and state services).
  - Telemetry endpoints such as `/api/telemetry/topics` and `/api/telemetry/stream/...`.
  - Actuator endpoints `/api/actuators` and `/api/actuators/<actuator>` (referenced in `automation_engine/engine.py` and `presentation_service/server/app.py`).

### PORTS:

- Host `8080` mapped to container port `8080` (`"8080:8080"` in `docker-compose.yml`).

### PERSISTENCE EVALUATION

- No explicit volumes defined for this container in `docker-compose.yml`; its data is not configured as persistent within this project definition.

### EXTERNAL SERVICES CONNECTIONS

- Acts as an external service for other containers:
  - `ingestion-service` polls and subscribes via HTTP and SSE (e.g., `http://mars-simulator:8080/api/sensors/...`, `.../api/telemetry/stream/...`).
  - `state` service calls `http://mars-simulator:8080/api/sensors`, `/api/telemetry/topics`, `/api/actuators`.
  - `automation-engine` calls `http://mars-simulator:8080/api/actuators`.
  - `presentation-service` calls `http://mars-simulator:8080/api/actuators/<actuator>` via `/switch_actuator`.

### MICROSERVICES:

#### MICROSERVICE: mars-simulator

* TYPE: backend

* DESCRIPTION: HTTP API simulator that exposes sensor, telemetry, and actuator endpoints used by the ingestion, state, automation, and presentation services. The actual implementation is external to this repo.

* PORTS: 8080 (inside container; exposed as `8080:8080`).

* SERVICE ARCHITECTURE:

  Acts as an upstream REST/SSE provider. Other microservices perform:
  - Periodic GET requests to sensor endpoints (`/api/sensors/<id>`) and telemetry SSE streams (`/api/telemetry/stream/...`).

## CONTAINER_NAME: message-broker

### DESCRIPTION:

RabbitMQ message broker providing AMQP messaging for telemetry and sensor data distribution across services. Defined in `src/docker-compose.yml` as `message-broker` using image `rabbitmq:3-management`.

### USER STORIES:

- Enables real-time distribution of ingested sensor and telemetry data so that:
  - The automation engine can apply rules.
  - The state service can forward updates to the frontend.
  - The report service can generate historical reports for selected sensors.

### PORTS:

- `5672:5672` (AMQP).
- `15672:15672` (RabbitMQ management UI).

### PERSISTENCE EVALUATION

- No `volumes` defined specifically for this service in `docker-compose.yml`; broker data (queues/messages) are not explicitly persisted across container restarts within this project configuration.

### EXTERNAL SERVICES CONNECTIONS

- No outgoing connections to other external systems defined here.
- Internal AMQP connections from:
  - `ingestion-service` (producer).
  - `automation-engine` (consumer).
  - `state` (consumer).
  - `report-service` (consumer).

### MICROSERVICES:

#### MICROSERVICE: message-broker (RabbitMQ)

* TYPE: backend

* DESCRIPTION: Provides topic-based messaging (`exchange_data` topic exchange) for normalized sensor and telemetry messages.

* PORTS: 5672, 15672.

* TECHNOLOGICAL SPECIFICATION:
  - RabbitMQ 3 with management plugin (`rabbitmq:3-management`).

* SERVICE ARCHITECTURE:

  - Topic exchange `exchange_data` declared by all connected services (`ingestion_service/app.py`, `automation_engine/engine.py`, `state/state.py`, `report_service/report-generator.py`).
  - Producers publish messages with routing key equal to the normalized sensor topic (e.g., `message["topic"]`).
  - Consumers bind queues to the exchange using:
    - Specific topics from automation rules (`automation-engine`).
    - Wildcard `#` for all topics (`state`).
    - Specific topics registered via `/change_sensor_tracking` (`report-service`).

* ENDPOINTS:

  N/A (AMQP service, not HTTP).

## CONTAINER_NAME: rule-database

### DESCRIPTION:

PostgreSQL database storing automation rules, built from `src/database` directory. It holds the `rules` table which is queried and updated by the `presentation-service` and used indirectly by `automation-engine`.

### USER STORIES:

#### US-15 – Persist automation rules

### PORTS:

- `5432:5432` (PostgreSQL default port).

### PERSISTENCE EVALUATION

- Uses volume `postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data` mapped in `docker-compose.yml`, providing persistent storage for rules across container restarts.

### EXTERNAL SERVICES CONNECTIONS

- Receives connections from `presentation-service` via `psycopg2-binary` (`db.py` in `presentation_service/server`).
- No outgoing connections defined.

### MICROSERVICES:

#### MICROSERVICE: rules-db (PostgreSQL)

* TYPE: backend

* DESCRIPTION: Stores automation rules in a single `rules` table, populated initially from `schema.sql`.

* PORTS: 5432.

* TECHNOLOGICAL SPECIFICATION:
  - PostgreSQL (version implied by official image, not pinned in `docker-compose.yml`).
  - SQL schema defined in `src/database/schema.sql`.

* SERVICE ARCHITECTURE:

  - Single database `rules_db` (from environment `POSTGRES_DB`).
  - Single table `rules` used for automation rules.
  - `presentation-service` performs CRUD on `rules` via SQL (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).
  - `automation-engine` queries rules indirectly by calling `presentation-service:/get_rule` rather than connecting directly to the DB.

* DB STRUCTURE:

  ***rules*** : | ***id*** | name, sensor_name, operator, threshold_value, unit, actuator_name, actuator_state, enabled, created_at

  - From `schema.sql`:

    - `id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY`
    - `name TEXT`
    - `sensor_name TEXT NOT NULL`
    - `operator TEXT NOT NULL`
    - `threshold_value DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL`
    - `unit TEXT`
    - `actuator_name TEXT NOT NULL`
    - `actuator_state TEXT CHECK (actuator_state IN ('ON','OFF')) NOT NULL`

## CONTAINER_NAME: ingestion-service

### DESCRIPTION:

Python service that ingests sensor and telemetry data from the `mars-simulator` via REST and SSE, normalizes messages, and publishes them to RabbitMQ (`message-broker`) on exchange `exchange_data`. Built from `src/ingestion_service`.

### USER STORIES:

- Supports real-time monitoring and automation by ensuring sensor and telemetry data flows continuously into the messaging backbone and downstream services.

### PORTS:

- No ports exposed in `docker-compose.yml` (runs as an internal worker).

### PERSISTENCE EVALUATION

- No volumes defined; service is stateless, with no on-disk persistence in this container.

### EXTERNAL SERVICES CONNECTIONS

- Connects to:
  - `mars-simulator` over HTTP/SSE for:
    - REST sensor endpoints `GET_TOPICS` (e.g., `http://mars-simulator:8080/api/sensors/<id>`).
    - Telemetry SSE endpoints `SSE_TOPICS` (e.g., `http://mars-simulator:8080/api/telemetry/stream/mars/telemetry/solar_array`).
  - `message-broker` (RabbitMQ) using `pika`.

### MICROSERVICES:

#### MICROSERVICE: ingestion-service

* TYPE: backend

* DESCRIPTION: Headless ingestion microservice that periodically polls REST endpoints and subscribes to SSE streams from the simulator, normalizes all messages into a unified schema, and publishes them to RabbitMQ.

* PORTS: None exposed.

* TECHNOLOGICAL SPECIFICATION:
  - Language: Python 3.11 (from Dockerfile).
  - Libraries: `requests`, `pika`, `sseclient-py` (from `requirements.txt`).
  - Custom module: `sensor_normalizer.py`.

* SERVICE ARCHITECTURE:

  - On startup (`if __name__ == "__main__":` in `app.py`):
    - Creates a persistent RabbitMQ connection and channel via `create_connection()`, declares `exchange_data` (topic exchange).
    - Starts multiple threads:
      - SSE listener threads (`listen_sse`) per `SSE_TOPICS`.
      - Periodic polling threads (`poll_get`) per `GET_TOPICS`.
  - Each received message is normalized via:
    - `normalize_message(msg)` which infers source type and calls `normalize_sensor_reading`.
    - Attaches `topic` equal to normalized `id`.
  - Publishes normalized messages with routing key `message["topic"]` to exchange `exchange_data` using `send_to_rabbitmq`.

* ENDPOINTS:

  N/A (no HTTP server defined).

## CONTAINER_NAME: automation-engine

### DESCRIPTION:

Automation engine that consumes normalized sensor/telemetry messages from RabbitMQ, applies automation rules from the rules database (via `presentation-service`), and issues actuator commands back to the simulator via the presentation backend. Exposes an HTTP API for dynamic rule-topic subscription updates. Built from `src/automation_engine`.

### USER STORIES:

#### US-11 - Automated Actuator control

### PORTS:

- `6000:6000` (HTTP API endpoint for rule updates).

### PERSISTENCE EVALUATION

- No volumes defined; this service is stateless. Rule and sensor configuration are persisted externally in the `rule-database` and managed through the `presentation-service`.

### EXTERNAL SERVICES CONNECTIONS

- Connects to:
  - `message-broker` (RabbitMQ) via `pika` on host `message-broker`, exchange `exchange_data`.
  - `presentation-service` HTTP API (`http://presentation-service:5050/rules` and `/get_rule`, `/switch_actuator`).
  - `mars-simulator` indirectly via `presentation-service` `/switch_actuator` which posts to simulator.

### MICROSERVICES:

#### MICROSERVICE: automation-engine

* TYPE: backend

* DESCRIPTION: Flask-based automation engine that subscribes to selected RabbitMQ topics, evaluates rules for incoming sensor data, and triggers actuator changes via the presentation backend. It also exposes an HTTP endpoint for updating RabbitMQ bindings when rules change.

* PORTS: 6000.

* TECHNOLOGICAL SPECIFICATION:
  - Language: Python 3.11 (`Dockerfile`).
  - Frameworks/Libraries: `Flask`, `pika`, `requests`, `operator` (standard lib).
  - Queue: RabbitMQ (via `pika`).

* SERVICE ARCHITECTURE:

  - Global configuration: `RABBIT_HOST`, `EXCHANGE_NAME`, `RULES_API_URL`.
  - On startup (`if __name__ == "__main__":` in `engine.py`):
    - Calls `connect_rabbitmq()` to connect to the broker, declare `exchange_data`, declare an exclusive queue, and store `channel`, `connection`, `queue_name`.
    - Calls `sync_rules_on_startup()`:
      - Fetches all rules via `GET http://presentation-service:5050/rules`.
      - Extracts unique `sensor_name` values and binds its queue to `exchange_data` for each topic.
    - Starts RabbitMQ consumer in a background thread (`start_rabbitmq` with `basic_consume` and callback `process_message`).
    - Runs the Flask app on `0.0.0.0:6000`.
  - `process_message`:
    - Parses messages from RabbitMQ, obtains `topic`, logs, then calls `RULES_API_URL` (`/get_rule`) with `{ "sensor_name": topic }`.
    - Iterates over returned rule rows, checks `enabled`, operator, threshold, and compares with each measurement value.
    - Fetches current actuator states from `mars-simulator:/api/actuators` to avoid redundant commands.
    - For triggered rules, posts to `http://presentation-service:5050/switch_actuator` with `{ "actuator": actuator_name, "state": actuator_state, "sender": "engine" }`.
  - The Flask endpoint `/update-rules` is used by the backend to dynamically add/remove queue bindings based on new or removed rules.

## CONTAINER_NAME: state

### DESCRIPTION:

Python service that builds a snapshot of available sensors, telemetry topics, and actuators from the simulator, then subscribes to all RabbitMQ topics and forwards messages to the presentation service’s `/update_sensor` endpoint. Built from `src/state`.

### USER STORIES:

- Enables the frontend to display real-time data by ensuring all messages on `exchange_data` are forwarded to the presentation service, which in turn broadcasts via WebSockets.

### PORTS:

- `6001:6001` in `docker-compose.yml`, but the `state.py` main block does not start an HTTP server; this port mapping is unused in the current code.

### PERSISTENCE EVALUATION

- No volumes defined; the state is in-memory (dictionary `STATE`) and lost on restart.

### EXTERNAL SERVICES CONNECTIONS

- Connects to:
  - `mars-simulator` over HTTP for initial discovery of `sensors`, `telemetry` topics, and `actuators`.
  - `message-broker` (RabbitMQ) for consuming all topics.
  - `presentation-service` via HTTP POST to `/update_sensor` for forwarding measurements.

### MICROSERVICES:

#### MICROSERVICE: state-service

* TYPE: backend

* DESCRIPTION: Headless consumer that subscribes to all telemetry/sensor topics from RabbitMQ and forwards them to the presentation backend for frontend WebSocket broadcasting.

* PORTS: None used (though `6001` is mapped in docker-compose, it is not utilized in `state.py`).

* TECHNOLOGICAL SPECIFICATION:
  - Language: Python 3.11.
  - Libraries: `pika`, `requests`, `json`, `time`.

* SERVICE ARCHITECTURE:

  - On startup (`if __name__ == "__main__":` in `state.py`):
    - Waits for simulator readiness and calls:
      - `GET http://mars-simulator:8080/api/sensors`.
      - `GET http://mars-simulator:8080/api/telemetry/topics`.
      - `GET http://mars-simulator:8080/api/actuators`.
    - Builds an initial `STATE` dict with keys for all sensors, telemetry topics, and actuators.
    - Connects to RabbitMQ (`connect_to_rabbitmq`), declares `exchange_data`, declares an exclusive queue, and binds it with routing key `#` (all topics).
    - Starts consuming with `basic_consume` and callback `callback`.
  - `callback`:
    - Parses each message, logs, and POSTs `{ "topic": data['topic'], "measurements": data['measurements'] }` to `http://presentation-service:5050/update_sensor`.

* ENDPOINTS:

  N/A (no HTTP server defined).

## CONTAINER_NAME: report-service

### DESCRIPTION:

Python + Flask service that consumes selected sensor messages from RabbitMQ, maintains short in-memory histories, and generates PDF reports with plots and basic statistics when sufficient data is collected. It exposes an HTTP endpoint for changing which topics are tracked and subscribed. Built from `src/report_service`.

### USER STORIES:

#### US-17 – Export sensor charts to PDF

### PORTS:

- `3030:3030`.

### PERSISTENCE EVALUATION

- Uses a `reports` volume mapped to `/app/reports` (`./reports:/app/reports` in docker-compose), so generated PDFs are persisted and shared with the host.

### EXTERNAL SERVICES CONNECTIONS

- Connects to:
  - `message-broker` (RabbitMQ) via `pika`, exchange `exchange_data`.
- Receives connections from:
  - `presentation-service` via `/change_sensor_tracking` endpoint URL (`http://report-service:3030/change_sensor_tracking`).

### MICROSERVICES:

#### MICROSERVICE: report-service

* TYPE: backend

* DESCRIPTION: Flask microservice that subscribes to specific sensor topics on RabbitMQ, accumulates recent measurements, and generates PDF reports using Matplotlib when a configurable history length is reached. It exposes an HTTP endpoint for the presentation service to add/remove topics for tracking.

* PORTS: 3030.

* TECHNOLOGICAL SPECIFICATION:
  - Language: Python 3.11.
  - Frameworks/Libraries: `Flask`, `pika`, `matplotlib`, `statistics`, `datetime`, `collections.deque`.
  - Output format: PDF files stored under `/app/reports/<topic>/`.

* SERVICE ARCHITECTURE:

  - On startup (`if __name__ == "__main__":` in `report-generator.py`):
    - Connects to RabbitMQ (`connect_rabbitmq`), declares `exchange_data`, declares an exclusive queue, and stores `channel`, `connection`, `queue_name`.
    - Starts `start_rabbitmq()` in a background thread to `basic_consume` with callback `process_message`.
    - Runs the Flask app on `0.0.0.0:3030`.
  - `sensor_data_history`: dict mapping topics to bounded `deque` (`MAX_HISTORY` elements).
  - `process_message`:
    - Parses payload, looks up `topic` in `sensor_data_history`; if not tracked, returns.
    - Extracts first measurement’s `metric`, `value`, and `captured_at` timestamp.
    - Appends a record to the deque and, if history length reaches `MAX_HISTORY`, spawns a thread (`pdf_worker`) to call `generate_pdf_report` and resets the deque.
  - `generate_pdf_report`:
    - Builds time-series plots and calculates mean/variance, then saves PDF per `topic` into `PDF_OUTPUT_DIR` under a timestamped filename.
  - Flask endpoint `/change_sensor_tracking` allows external services to add/remove topics from tracking and to bind/unbind the RabbitMQ queue for those topics.
